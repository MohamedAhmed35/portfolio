Mall Customer Segmentation
This project involves the analysis and clustering of customer data from a mall to identify distinct groups of customers based on their characteristics and spending behavior. The dataset contains information about 200 customers, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The primary goal is to apply clustering techniques to group customers into segments that can be used for targeted marketing and personalized services.
