## **Predict Student dropout (Classification)**
   - **Description**: The student dropout prediction project applies machine learning to predict students' likelihood of dropping out based on factors like application mode and Scholarship holde. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. The goal is to identify at-risk students and enhance retention strategies.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-Learn, pandas, seaborn, numpy, SVM, Random Forst, Logistic Regression, KNN.

   - **Description**: The Iris classification project uses machine learning to categorize iris flowers into three species, Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica, based on sepal and petal measurements. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to achieve accurate predictions and assess model performance.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Sckit-Learn, pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNeighbors

## **Mall Customer Segmentation (Clustering**
   - **Description**: This project analyzes and clusters mall customer data to identify distinct segments based on gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to use clustering techniques to group customers for targeted marketing and   personalized services.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, K-mean, Agglomerative Clustering
   - **Details**: [Mall Customer Segmentation][mall-segmentation]
